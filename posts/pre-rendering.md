I have been programming as a hobby for over 20 years, and it has always been a passion of mine. I am constantly amazed at the incredible things that can be accomplished through code, and the endless possibilities for creation and problem-solving. One of the things that drew me to software development was the ability to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.

When I first discovered that I could make Android apps, I was absolutely thrilled. The idea that I could create something that would run on my phone and potentially be used by others was mind-blowing to me. So, I decided to dive into the world of app development and develop a running tracker app to help me keep track of my long-distance runs as I was preparing to join the Navy. It was a fun project to work on, and it gave me a taste of what it's like to develop a real-world application from scratch.

Since then, I have been pursuing software development in a variety of areas, both as a hobby and as a career. I am currently pursuing formal education in computer science while also working on acquiring and improving my skills in many areas of software development. One of my main areas of focus right now is front-end web development using tools like React, Next.js, and Spring. I am also working on my back-end development skills with Python, Java, SQL, R, and other data analysis tools. I believe that having a diverse set of skills is essential for a successful career in software development.

In preparation for my upcoming internship search through the DOD Skillbridge program, I have decided to build a portfolio website to showcase my skills and experience. My goal is to use this project as an opportunity to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and Sass skills while also learning more about React and Next.js.

I chose to use the Next.js framework for my portfolio site because I believe it will give me the flexibility I need to showcase my skills effectively. One of the main advantages of using Next.js is that it allows for easy integration with other front-end tools and libraries, which will make it easier for me to build and maintain the site.

Another benefit of Next.js is that it offers a range of performance optimizations out of the box. This means that my site will load quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for providing a good user experience. Additionally, Next.js supports automatic code splitting, which means that only the code that is necessary for each page is loaded, reducing the overall page size and improving performance.

In terms of showcasing my skills, Next.js offers a range of features that will allow me to highlight my abilities in various areas of software development. For example, I can use Next.js to build interactive data visualizations, create server-side APIs, or develop custom user interfaces with React components.

Overall, I am really excited about this project and can't wait to get started. I believe that building a portfolio website will be a valuable experience in and of itself, and I am confident that it will help me stand out to potential employers in my internship search. I can't wait to see what I can create!
