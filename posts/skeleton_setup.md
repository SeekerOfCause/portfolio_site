To get started with building your website, you first needed to install the necessary packages and set up the framework for your site. You used Node.js to do this, which is a popular JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to build server-side applications.

The first step was to install the necessary packages for your site using Node.js. You did this by running the npm (Node Package Manager) command in your terminal. Specifically, you used the create-next-app command to create a new Next.js project, which installed all of the necessary packages and set up the basic structure of your site. This is a quick and easy way to get started with building a website using Next.js.

Once you had created your Next.js project, you needed to set up the framework for your site. This involved creating an index.js file for your home page, and a layout.js file to handle the layout of your site. The index.js file contained the content for your home page, while the layout.js file defined the layout and styling for your site.

You used the import statement to bring in various components and styles to your site, such as the Head component, which allows you to add metadata to your site's head tag, and the Flexbox component, which allows you to create flexible layouts using CSS flexbox.

You also used props to pass data between components, such as passing the title of your site to the Head component, and passing the content of your home page to the layout.js file. This allowed you to create a consistent layout and style across your site, while still allowing for customization on individual pages.

One of the key benefits of using Next.js for your site was the ability to easily create links between pages. You used the Link component to create links that allowed users to navigate between different pages on your site. This is a powerful feature that allows for a smooth and intuitive user experience.

Finally, you used CSS flexbox to lay out the content on your site. Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating flexible, responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. You used properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to create the layout for your site.

Overall, building your portfolio website with Next.js allowed you to quickly and easily set up the framework for your site, while still allowing for customization and flexibility. You were able to create a consistent layout and style across your site, while still allowing for individual pages to have their own unique content. With the ability to easily create links between pages and create flexible layouts using CSS flexbox, Next.js provided a powerful platform for showcasing your skills and experience as a software developer.
